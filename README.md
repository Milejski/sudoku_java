# sudoku_java

Sudoku game written in java, using Swing.

At first, the idea was to remade sudoku.c  using java, hovewer it quickly became obvious that the way java handles terminal comunication makes it quite difficult. Also, thanks to abandoning terminal linux compability was gained and knowledge about java Swing was obtained.

Project is still in development, but main problems involving windows poping in and out of view are resolved. What remains is simply rewriting code from sudoku.c.
